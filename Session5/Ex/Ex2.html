            Swift is considered a representative figure in the popular music
            industry and is the focus of all public attention. Swift has
            released six studio albums, with the first four being sent to
            country radio, beginning with her debut album Taylor Swift (2006).
            She followed this with Fearless (2008), which explored pop and
            country influences, and the singles "Love Story" and "You Belong
            with Me" that helped her gain mainstream recognition. Swift followed
            that with her third studio album, Speak Now (2010), which featured a
            more rock-influenced style, and her fourth studio album Red (2012),
            which added electronic elements, and spawned her first number-one
            single on the Billboard Hot 100, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back
            Together". In 2014, Swift shed her "country princess" image and
            released her fifth album 1989 (2014), which drew inspiration from
            1980s synth-pop and featured the chart-topping hits "Shake It Off",
            "Blank Space" and "Bad Blood". The media scrutiny inspired her to
            release her sixth studio album Reputation (2017), which drew on hip
            hop influences and featured the number-one single "Look What You
            Made Me Do".
