            <span><b>This is the second item's accordion body.</b>
                it is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin
                adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
                element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well
                as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify
                any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. it's also
                worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <span
                    class="special_title">.accordion-body</span>,
                though the transition does limit overflow.
